# Implement Azure Kubernetes Service

## Objectives

In this lab, you will:

+ Task 1: Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster
+ Task 2: Deploy pods into the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster
+ Task 3: Scale containerized workloads in the Azure Kubernetes service cluster


## Instructions

### Exercise 1

#### Task 1: Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster

In this task, you will deploy an Azure Kubernetes Services cluster by using the Azure portal.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the Azure portal, search for locate **Kubernetes services** and then, on the **Kubernetes services** blade, click **+ Add**. 

1. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create Kubernetes cluster** blade, specify the following settings (leave others with their default values):

    | Setting | Value |
    | ---- | ---- |
    | Subscription | the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
    | Resource group | the name of a new resource group **aks-rg** |
    | Kubernetes cluster name | **aks1** |
    | Region | the name of a region where you can provision a Kubernetes cluster |
    | Kubernetes version | accept the default |
    | Node size | accept the default |
    | Node count | **1** |

1. Click **Next: Node Pools >** and, on the **Node Pools** tab of the **Create Kubernetes cluster** blade, specify the following settings (leave others with their default values):

    | Setting | Value |
    | ---- | ---- |
    | Virtual nodes | **Disabled** |
    | VM scale sets | **Enabled** |
	
1. Click **Next: Authentication >** and, on the **Authentication** tab of the **Create Kubernetes cluster** blade, specify the following settings (leave others with their default values):

    | Setting | Value |
    | ---- | ---- |
    | Service principal | accept the default |
    | Enable RBAC | **Yes** |


1. Click **Next: Networking >** and, on the **Networking** tab of the **Create Kubernetes cluster** blade, specify the following settings (leave others with their default values):

    | Setting | Value |
    | ---- | ---- |
    | DNS name prefix | any valid, globally unique DNS host name |
    | HTTP application routing | **No** |
    | Load balancer | **Standard** |
    | Network configuration | **Advanced** |

1. Click **Next: Integration >**, on the **Integration** tab of the **Create Kubernetes cluster** blade, set **Container monitoring** to **Disabled**, click **Review + create** and then click **Create**. 

    >**Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete. This should take about 10 minutes.


#### Task 2: Deploy pods into the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster

In this task, you will deploy a pod into the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster.

1. On the deployment blade, click the **Go to resource** link.

1. On the **aks1** Kubernetes service blade, in the **Settings** section, click **Node pools**.

1. On the **aks1 - Node pools** blade, verify that the cluster consists of a single pool with one node.

1. In the Azure portal, open the **Azure Cloud Shell** by clicking on the icon in the top right of the Azure Portal.

1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **Bash**. 

    >**Note**: If this is the first time you are starting **Cloud Shell** and you are presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you are using in this lab, and click **Create storage**. 

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to retrieve the credentials to access the AKS cluster:

    ```sh
    RESOURCE_GROUP='aks-rg1'

    AKS_CLUSTER='aks1'

    az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $AKS_CLUSTER
    ``` 

1. From the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following to verify connectivity to the AKS cluster:

    ```sh
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

1. In the **Cloud Shell** pane, review the output and verify that the one node which the cluster consists of at this point is reporting the **Ready** status. 

1. From the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following to deploy the **nginx** image from the Docker Hub:

    ```sh
    kubectl create deployment nginx-deployment --image=nginx
    ```


1. From the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following to verify that a Kubernetes pod has been created:

    ```sh
    kubectl get pods
    ```

1. From the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following to identify the state of the deployment:

    ```sh
    kubectl get deployment
    ```

1. From the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following to make the pod available from Internet:

    ```sh
    kubectl expose deployment nginx-deployment --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
    ```

1. From the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following to identify whether a public IP address has been provisioned:

    ```sh
    kubectl get service
    ```

1. Re-run the command until the value in the **EXTERNAL-IP** column for the **nginx-deployment** entry changes from **\<pending\>** to a public IP address. Note the public IP address in the **EXTERNAL-IP** column for **nginx-deployment**.

1. Open a browser window and navigate to the IP address you obtained in the previous step. Verify that the browser page displays the **Welcome to nginx!** message.

#### Task 3: Scale containerized workloads in the Azure Kubernetes service cluster

In this task, you will scale horizontally the number of pods and then number of cluster nodes.

1. From the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following to scale the deployment by increasing of the number of pods to 2:

    ```sh
    kubectl scale --replicas=2 deployment/nginx-deployment
    ```

1. From the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following to verify the outcome of scaling the deployment:

    ```sh
    kubectl get pods
    ```

    > **Note**: Review the output of the command and verify that the number of pods increased to 2.

1. From the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following to scale out the cluster by increasing the number of nodes to 2:

    ```sh
    az aks scale --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $AKS_CLUSTER --node-count 2
    ```

    > **Note**: Wait for the provisioning of the additional node to complete. This might take about 3 minutes. If it fails, rerun the `az aks scale` command.

1. From the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following to verify the outcome of scaling the cluster:

    ```sh
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

    > **Note**: Review the output of the command and verify that the number of nodes increased to 2.

1. From the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following to scale the deployment:

    ```
    kubectl scale --replicas=10 deployment/nginx-deployment
    ```

1. From the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following to verify the outcome of scaling the deployment:

    ```
    kubectl get pods
    ```

    > **Note**: Review the output of the command and verify that the number of pods increased to 10.

1. From the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following to review the pods distribution across cluster nodes:

    ```
    kubectl get pod -o=custom-columns=NODE:.spec.nodeName,POD:.metadata.name
    ```

    > **Note**: Review the output of the command and verify that the pods are distributed across both nodes.

1. From the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following to delete the deployment:

    ```
    kubectl delete deployment nginx-deployment
    ```

1. Close the **Cloud Shell** pane.


#### Clean up resources

   >**Note**: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges.

1. In the Azure portal, open the **Bash** shell session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.

1. List all resource groups created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

   ```sh
   az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'aks-rg')].name" --output tsv
   ```

1. Delete all resource groups you created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

   ```sh
   az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'aks-rg')].[name]" --output tsv | xargs -L1 bash -c 'az group delete --name $0 --no-wait --yes'
   ```
